The goal of the project is to uncover patterns in meteorite landings. First, we aimed to find where meteorites most commonly fall. Second, we explored trends in their types and sizes over time. Finally, we aimed to predict which areas might be at higher risk for future meteorite impacts.To achieve this, we use maps, data mining techniques, and prediction models. We also looked for connections between a meteoriteâ€™s size, type, and the year it fell.
